"""
USAGE: python src/combine.py <n>
<n>: number of files to merge*

*must have been generated with `divide.py`

Combines processed sample parts into one combined processed sample file.

Only use this after processing each of the sample parts,
so that you have a `p-` prefix in front of each filename.

This script will generate a file equivalent to processing the
entire sample, but allows you to use a multithreaded process
(see `process.py`) to process distinct chunks of the file instead,
and then stich them back together.
